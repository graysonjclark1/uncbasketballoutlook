# UNC Basketball Outlook

This project uses a simple machine learning model to predict the UNC men's basketball team's NCAA tournament performance based on seasonal statistics by the number of games played in a season. The project uses Python scripts to scrape current season game data from Sports Reference, processes performance metrics (points scored, points allowed, and Simple Rating System), and employs a Random Forest classifier to predict tournament outcomes. The application includes a web interface to display predictions at this current point in the season.
